XSS Vulnerability
	>>Allows an attacker to inject javascript code into the page
	>>Code is executed when the page loads
	>>Code is executed on the client machine not on the server

Three main types: Reflected XSS
                  Stored XSS
                  DOM XSS

EXPLOITING XSS
	>>HTML  Attribute URL script style
	>>Test text boxes and urls parameters on the form
  

REFLECTED XSS
	>>Not stored
	>>Only work if the target visits a specially crafted url
    eg:http://target.com/something=<script>alert(1)</script>

               USER -> BROWSER -> SERVER

Stored XSS
	Stored in database
	The injected code is executed everytime the page is loaded

               USER -> BROWSER -> SERVER -> DATABASE

DOM XSS
               USER -> BROWSER

METHODOLOGY
	>>Find all the pages with parameters
	>>Give any input there (payload)
	>>We need to locate all the places on the page our input ended up.
	>>Next we need to detect what kind of filters are there and where are they located.
	>>We will choose the place that is the weakest and easiest to execute an XSS attack.

	>>#This can be easily done with burp
      spider this
      filter urls having parameter
      check input is reflecting or not
      Make payloads for this and  upload paylods in intruder
