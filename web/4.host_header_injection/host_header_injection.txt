#Host Header Injection
In many cases, developers are trusting the host header value and using it to generate links, import scripts and even generate password reset links with its value.This is a very bad idea, because the http host header can be controlled by an attacker. This can be exploited using web-cache poisoning and by abusing alternative channels like password reset emails.

#Host Header attack hunting 
    >>Change host to bing.com if its reflected then there is a chance of host header injection.
    >>Add X-Forwarded Host to bing.com, if its redirected then there is host header injection.

#Web cache poisoning through host header injection
	1.Find a url having status code 2xx/3xx.
	2.You have to try once on each 2xx.
	3.If internal domain will change after that then there is a host header injection attack

	Change host to bing.com,if it is reflecting then check at which link it is reflecting.Click on that link and if it is redirecting to different domain, then there is a web cache poisoning
