Missing SPF

1.Map the application
    subdomains
    robots.txt
    nikto                                                                        JNSR
    javascript enabled and disabled
    
2.Analyze the application
    Application is created for what
    what technologies are used for creating application                          TCS
    map the attack surface like spider this host
  
  
Try ZAP, skipfish
  
3.Test Client Side Controls
    lenght limit
    bypass filter by intercepting the request    client side verification        CLC
    cookies urls
    
4.Authentication
    password quality
    rate limiting
    username enumeration                                                         TRUCPF
    forgot password
    check for unsafe transmission of credentials
    test for logic flaw
    
5.Session Management
    insecure transmission of tokens
    CSRF    
    session fixation                                                                    ICC
    cookie scope
    
6.Test Access Controls
    Multiple accounts
    insecure access control methods like PUT HEAD
    test with limited access(Try to perform high user action with low user)     MIL
    
7.Test for Input Based Vulnerability
    Path traversal
    File Inclusion
    Injections                                                                  FIPX
    XSS  
    
8.Test for Function Specific Vulnerabilities
    SMTP injection
    SOAP injection
    XXE
    Buffer Overflow
    LDAP injection
    
9.Test for Logic Flaws
    Depend on the application
    
10.Test for shared hosting Issues
    Test segregation in shared infrastructure
    test segregation b/w ASP hosted application
    
11.Test for application server functionality
    default credentials
    default content
    dangerous http methods
    web server software bug
    test for web application firewall
    
12.Miscellaneous checks
    
13.Information leakage
