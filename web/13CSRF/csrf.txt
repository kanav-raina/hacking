CROSS SITE REQUEST FORGERY

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they are currently authenticated.

	>>Request are not validated at the server side
	>>Server does not check if the user generated the request
	>>Requests can be forged and sent to users to make them do things they don't intend to do such as changing their password

Injection Point for CSRF
	CSRF can be :-Get Based
                  Post Based

CSRF on logout page

GET Based (Send link to a victim and our actions get executed)
POST Based(create HTML file & then you have to execute)

Prevention:
	>>Server will only accept form if the unique token is returned

Dynamic Synchronizing Token
	1.Generate an unpredictable token that can not be reused
		>>Tokens need to be a large value
		>>It must be random
		>>It should be unique
		>>Other factors can be inclulded in token generation algorithm

	2.Embed the token in HTML page in hidden form.
	3.Verify the token when form is submitted.
