#Source Code Disclosure
Source Code often contains some form of senstive information- whether it be configuration related information(eg . database credentials) or simply information on how the web application functions.If disclosed, such information can potentially be used by an attacker to discover logical flaws and escalate into a subsequent chain of attacks which would not be possible without having access to the application's source code.

Eg :- GET /showimage.php?file=database_connect.php

site:abc.com  index.of.backup

site.com/.git

index of /.git site

File Inclustion often leads to source code disclosure
