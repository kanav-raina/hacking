Hackers can claim subdomains with the help of external services.This attack is personally non-traceable,and affects atleast 17 large service providers and multiple domains are affected.

Attack Scenario:
	Your company start using a new service,eg an external Support Ticketing Service .
	Your company points to a subdomain to the support ticketing service,eg support.yourdomain.com
	Your company stops using this service but does not remove the subdomain redirection pointing to the ticketing system.
	Attacket signs up for the service and claims the domain as theirs.No verification is done by Service Provider, and the DNS setup is already correctly setup.
	Attacker can now build a complete clone of the real site, add a login form.redirect the user, steal credentials(eg admin account), cookies and or completely destroy business credibility for your company.

Three things that make this scenario worse
	Its super easy.Sign up for a new account and claim the domain.
	Its completely hidden.The domain owner won't notice.The attacker won't leave any traces for the Domain Owner 
	The service provider is unlikely to be able to fix this in a feasible way.

Now if this was not bad enough, imagine this scenario
	A domain owner points their * DNS-Entry to eg Heroku.		           (// * is wildcard here)
	They forget to add the wildcard-entry to their Heroku app.
	Attacker can now claim any subdomain they want from the domain owner.
	A domain owner will be unaware of the subdomain being exploited.

STEPS:
	1.Find  a subdomain pointing to third party.
	2.Make sure their service is inactive or cancelled or expired.
	3.Go to that third party website, register as client and when they will ask to point your subdomain, you just give subdomain.com

eg: facebook.nokia.com
